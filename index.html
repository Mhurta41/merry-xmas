<h1>Merry Christmas, friends!</h1>
<div className='container'>
<p>A small token of my appreciation for all your love and support. Words cannot describe how much you all mean to me so I have infused all my love into this gift for you :) First of all? This bitch is ORGANIC. Second of all, made with a personal blend of essential oils. I was going for a "fresh spring embrace", please do let me know if I hit the mark lol And lastly, I have added a crystal somewhere throughout the candle as a fun surprise-as-you-melt concept.</p>
